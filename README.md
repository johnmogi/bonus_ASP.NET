# bonus_ASP.NET

In this bonus section I've studied ASP.NET and how to use it to create a simple web application.

## Part 1: Create and build a website

[] Created “ASP.NET Core Web App” project using visual studio.
[] by adding “Newtonsoft.Json" nuget package-
csproj content modified:

`<ItemGroup> <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" /> </ItemGroup>`

Compile (rebuild) your project
Which files and folders were created?

mostly everything you see in this repo, but publish added release and debug folders.
actual project files are in the release - publish folder.
